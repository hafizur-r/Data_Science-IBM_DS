    "### Introduction Section: \n",
    "The police of Denver, Colorado patrolling in the whole city. However, various crimes occurred in any part of the city. Due to the limited number of patrolling cars of the police department, most of the area is not covered by the police cars. Therefore, police need to know those areas, where most crimes have occurred. So that, they can cover most of the area by sending police car. The less crime area can be omitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand these, the police needs answers to several questions. The answers to those questions must be supported by data and analytics. These are their questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) How can we find those areas, where the most crimes have occurred?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) How can we find the most offensive crimes and the area?\n",

    "3) How can we find the most traffic area?"

Due to continuous data entry, the number of records in subsequent extractions are subject to change. Crime data is updated Monday through Friday.
